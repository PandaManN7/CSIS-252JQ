The program will show four people sitting at a table. Each person has one plate with two pancakes on top. In the middle of the table there is a rotating serving platter that only rotates one way. There are also four plates on top of the serving platter that also have two pancakes on top.

You can use the make file if you'd like. Just type make and prog6.

The only input required are integers that are prompted to the user. 

The class for this program is the stack type that I took from the book. I did add to it, like the print and add to, and I did change it a bit for my program to run. 

There is one logic error when you choose to switch to a new person, it should change the serving plate as well (since this person will be in front of a different plate than the person before them) but it does not. It continues on with the same serving plate as the person before them. I honestly didn't actually think about this until just now, while writing this. If you would like me to fix this, I can try my best to.

I tested this program on someone with no knowledge of coding to test the ease of use. They helped me with spelling and other errors that I had not spotted myself, as well.
